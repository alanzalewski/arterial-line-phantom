[brief description of phantom and its function]
[also pics]

### Materials & Equipment Needed
* 1/8th inch (?? i think) thick planks of wood (what kind)
* laser cutter
* ballistics gel (or another pourable, ultrasonic material)
* screws (specifics?)
* those little tubes
* valve tube ending
* crock pot
* fume hood
* heat resistant gloves

### Assembly Instructions
\* = more detail

1. Get the wood laser cut into those shapes.
2. Start melting the ballistics gel by cutting it into smaller chunks (roughly 1-2 inches on each side - prcision isn't important, this is just to make melting easier) and placing it in a crock pot in a fume hood at 200Â°C until molten. While waiting for it to melt, do steps 3 and 4.
3. \* Screw all 4 walls together (detailed instructions to come).
4. Feed the 2 tubes (arterial lines) through the holes. Make sure they aren't too taut, but also that they don't droop.
5. Once the gel has melted, pour it into the wooden mold while wearing heat resistant gloves.
6. \* Wait for the mold to cure and cool before removing the wooden mold.
7. \* Fill the tubes with fluid and cap with the little valve thingy that pressurizes it.
